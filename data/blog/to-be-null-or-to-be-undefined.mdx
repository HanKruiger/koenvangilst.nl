I got caught up in an interesting discussion on Twitter the other days about using null in JSON responses (from API's).

In the past my mental model for using `null` and `undefined` used to be this:

```json
{
  "foo": "bar",
  "baz": null,
  "qux": undefined
}
```

I must admit I've not given it much thought after settling on this model and I've been using it for years. Until I came across a tweet by ....

Turns out that many people consider the `null` to be superfleous and that using it should be avoided as much as possible.

In 2014 Douglas Crockford (the inventor of JSON) said the following about null and undefined:

"It doesn't make sense to have two of them and you treat them as though they're the same. We should get rid of one of them."

Based on this I'm going to change my mental model for JSON responses to this: act as if null doesn't exist and leave the fields out (ie. undefined):

Code

The result is JSON that is:

1. simpler & smaller
2. only about the data, not documentation
3. on the frontend you can reliably use `typeof(x)` (see screenshot)
4. simpler TypeScript types, no more: `type Product { price?: number | null; }`
